# Streams

Sequence of values

Three phases
1) Source -> The data source
2) Intermediate -> Filtering process that makes the data sequence more useful
3) Terminal -> Final place where you write/use those data.


# Source operations:

Three different ways to create streams

1) From collection
2) From Arrays
3) Using stream.iterate()
4) Using Stream.generate()
