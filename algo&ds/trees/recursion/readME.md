# Recursion

It is a function that calls itself until it doesn't.

- Every recursion must have a,
  - base case - has the return statement that breaks out of the loop.
  - recursive case - that calls the fucntion again.

If recursion happens in a function then *stackOverFlowError* can occur.

## Requirements

- You should be doing the same operation again and again.
- The problem must be getting slower at each recursive call.
