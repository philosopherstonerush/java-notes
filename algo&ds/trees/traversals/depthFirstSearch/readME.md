# Depth-First-Search

Has three modes of traversal 
- preOrder
- postOrder
- InOrder

This basically uses a stack but here we indirectly use it with the help of a inner class - this inner class also helps us to have a method inside a method. 

method inside method

depthFirstSearch() ---> traverse()
