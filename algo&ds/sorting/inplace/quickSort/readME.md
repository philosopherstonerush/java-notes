# Big Oh

space complexity - O(1) 

because its in-place algorithm. Its an advantage it has over merge sort.

time complexity 
- worst case (big Oh) - O(N^2)
  - Really inefficient when used for almost sorted arrays - use insertion sort instead - runs at O(N).
- average case - O(N log N)
  - excellent choice for random arrays.
