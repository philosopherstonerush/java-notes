# Algorithmic Complexity

Space complexity - O(N)

time complexity:
- to break it into single ints - O(log N)
- to merge them back together - O(N)

Therefore O(N log N)

Most of the inplace algorithms sort it using O(N^2), therefore we are going sort a thousand times then mergeSort shows considerable improvement.
