# Explanation

you can sell and buy on the same day which means you don't need to hold and optimize for the largest profit. Any increase between days is an increment of the max profit. (There's also the omniscient ability to "never buy" if the price never goes back up.)

# Input and Output

```json

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
